# discord-rhythmbox-plugin
A simple plugin for rhythmbox to update your rich presence in discord.
This is based off of the built-in im-status plugin and has some borrowed code; credit where credit is due!

## Usage
- Install `pypresence`:

`pip3 install pypresence`
(You can try it with sudo if it does not work)

- Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/ToppleKek/discord-rhythmbox-plugin.git`

- Put the `discord-rhythmbox-plugin` folder in `/usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins`
